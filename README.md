Build a Linux Embedded Image
Creating a custom bootable Linux distribution with Buildroot involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview of the process, along with a link to a GitHub repository with a simple example.

**Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment**

Buildroot, a cross-compiler, and other development tools. 

**Step 2: Configure Buildroot**

1. Douwnload from Builder Root
2. Create a custom configuration for your system. You can start with an existing one and modify it:

   ```bash
   make menuconfig
   ```

This command will open a configuration menu where you can select various options for your Linux distribution, including target architecture, packages, kernel version, and more. Make sure to enable options for creating a bootable image (e.g., an SD card image or an ISO image) in the "Build options" section.

3. Save your configuration and exit the menu.

**Step 3: Build Your Custom Linux Image**

Run the following command to build your Linux image:

```bash
make
```

This command will download and compile the selected packages, kernel, and root filesystem. The resulting image will be in the `output/images` directory.
